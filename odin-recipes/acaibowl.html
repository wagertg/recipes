                <ul>
                    <li>Frozen acai puree – the only one I’ve seen in the U.S. is Sambazon brand, see below for link to locations.</li>
                    <li>Frozen bananas – use ripe bananas for a sweeter acai bowl. Not underripe green or mushy overripe brown.</li>
                    <li>Fruit juice (such as apple or grape) – Coconut water or almond milk can be used as well, but fruit juice is sweeter.</li>
                    <li>Toppings – on a standard acai bowl you’ll tend to find blueberries, strawberries, bananas, granola and honey. Add more like coconut or other fruit to your hearts content.</li>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>It's a smoothie bowl with the smoothie made from acai berries. The bowl is loaded with toppings like sliced fruit and berries, granola, coconut and almond butter. Restaurants and food trucks across America serve them, but they are very easy to make at home.</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To high-powered blender, add partially thawed acai puree, along with frozen banana pieces, blueberries and juice.</li>
                <li>Blend on a moderately low speed until smooth (lower speed works better for this thickness). If needed, you can add a little more juice if it’s too thick to blend.</li>
                <li>Pour into chilled bowls.</li>
                <li>Top with granola, fruit and drizzle with honey if desired.</li>
             </ol>
